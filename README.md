### **AI Tools Used:**
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Only debugging and reference purposes (research, etc), no code was generated by the IA



### What assumptions did I made in this exercise?

1. **Business Data Structure**: Assumed a standardized business data structure, 
2. **Form Validation**: Assumed basic validation requirements - all fields are required and must contain non-empty values (including whitespace-only validation).
3. **Payment Processing**: Assumed no actual payment processing is needed.
4. **Design Implementation**: Since there where no design requirement it was assumed.
5. **Persistent storage**: No database base was used, data is stored temporary in the Front End.
